    "\n",
    "Text Classification can be used to solve various use-cases like sentiment analysis, spam detection, hashtag prediction etc. This notebook demonstrates the use of SageMaker BlazingText to perform supervised binary/multi class with single or multi label text classification. BlazingText can train the model on more than a billion words in a couple of minutes using a multi-core CPU or a GPU, while achieving performance on par with the state-of-the-art deep learning text classification algorithms. BlazingText extends the fastText text classifier to leverage GPU acceleration using custom CUDA kernels."

Then, the data from our channels are downloaded into the instance. Once this is done, the training job begins. The provisioning and data downloading will take some time, depending on the size of the data. Therefore it might be a few minutes before we start getting training logs for our training jobs.
